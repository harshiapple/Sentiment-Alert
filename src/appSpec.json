        "designSummary": "**The 'Quiet Confidence' Layout: An Elegant Fusion of Swiss Order and Serene Minimalism**\n\nThe Vision: To create a feedback management application that inspires trust and confidence through a clean, sophisticated, and highly usable interface. The design will evoke a sense of calm authority, like a well-organized executive suite. We will achieve this by blending the structured precision of the Swiss Grid with the airy spaciousness of Serene Minimalism.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The 12-Column Foundation: A strict 12-column grid will provide the underlying structure for all content. This ensures a consistent and predictable layout across all screen sizes.\n2. Whitespace as a Design Element: Generous whitespace is paramount. Use large margins and padding to create visual breathing room around all elements. This prevents the interface from feeling cluttered or overwhelming.\n3. Typographic Hierarchy: Establish a clear visual hierarchy using a classic serif font for headings and a clean sans-serif font for body text. Font sizes and weights should be carefully chosen to guide the user's eye.\n4. Subtle Metallic Accents: A soft gold or silver accent color will be used sparingly for key interactive elements, such as buttons and links. This adds a touch of luxury without being ostentatious.\n5. Ghost Button Styling: Buttons will primarily use a ghost style (thin outlines) or text-only to maintain a clean and minimalist aesthetic.",

Navy blue serves as the primary color for text and backgrounds, conveying professionalism and trust, while red is used strategically for emphasis and interactive elements such as buttons and highlights, adding energy and urgency. The cream background softens the overall contrast, providing warmth and approachability. Typography is elegant and traditional, with large, bold serif headlines that communicate confidence and experience, complemented by smaller serif body text for readability and formality. UI components like buttons are distinctly styled with rounded corners and clear color differentiation between primary and secondary actions. Minimal graphic elements and purposeful iconography maintain a clean, focused aesthetic that supports the brand's serious and results-driven tone.

The design will evoke a sense of calm authority, like a well-organized executive suite. We will achieve this by blending the structured precision of the Swiss Grid with the airy spaciousness of Serene Minimalism.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The 12-Column Foundation: A strict 12-column grid will provide the underlying structure for all content. This ensures a consistent and predictable layout across all screen sizes.\n2. Whitespace as a Design Element: Generous whitespace is paramount. Use large margins and padding to create visual breathing room around all elements. This prevents the interface from feeling cluttered or overwhelming.\n3. Typographic Hierarchy: Establish a clear visual hierarchy using a classic serif font for headings and a clean sans-serif font for body text. Font sizes and weights should be carefully chosen to guide the user's eye.\n4. Subtle Metallic Accents: A soft gold or silver accent color will be used sparingly for key interactive elements, such as buttons and links. This adds a touch of luxury without being ostentatious.\n5. Ghost Button Styling: Buttons will primarily use a ghost style (thin outlines) or text-only to maintain a clean and minimalist aesthetic.",
